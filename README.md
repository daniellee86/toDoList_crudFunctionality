# React To-Do list Application with CRUD functionality. 

This App was made whilst following a tutorial. I made it AFTER I created my own custom To-Do App (dOer) so that I could understand how the update funcationality was implemented in React, even though there are probably several ways of approaching it. 
It was helpful to build this app so that I could see how compartmentalized code and components work.
